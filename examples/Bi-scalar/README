# Bismuth in space group R-3m (No. 166) with Abinit: scalar case

This serves to illustrate the use of `IrRep` for DFT calculations run with Abinit, and the following parameters:

- `refUC`
- `IBend`
- `Ecut`
- `fWFK`
- `code`
- `kpnames`

# How to run the example:

If you are interested in the whole workflow, you will need to run first a DFT calculation of the wave functions (with Abinit in this case), to later pass this DFT data to `IrRep`. You can do all this proceduce by running:

```
bash run_all.sh
```

This calls Abinit with the input files stored in `dft_inputs`. The output of this DFT calculation will be saved in a directory called `dft_output`. Then, this data will be passed to `IrRep`, and the output files will be stored in `irrep_output`. You can compare this output to the reference data in `reference_output`. 

:warning: You might need to adapt the line `abinit < files.txt` in the file `run_all.sh` to your own Abinit environment/installation. 

In case you are not interested in the whole workflow, you can skip the DFT calculation and concentrate on the step of running `IrRep` with:

```
bash run_reference.sh
```

The output generated by `IrRep` will be stored in `irrep_output`.
